# Energy Demand Data Platform

This project ingests public energy demand data and processes it into analytics-ready datasets using Airflow and Python.

## Purpose

This project is designed to demonstrate end-to-end data engineering skills, including data ingestion, orchestration, and data layer design, using realistic tools and workflows.

## Data Source
- U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) API
  - Public energy demand and consumption datasets

## Architecture (High-level)
- Python scripts for data ingestion logic
- Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration
- Local Docker-based development environment
- Logical data layers documented in-repo

## Scope

This repository focuses on ingestion and orchestration.
Transformation, analytics modeling, and serving layers will be added incrementally as the project evolves.
